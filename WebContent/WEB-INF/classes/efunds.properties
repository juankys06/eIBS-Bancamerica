#these properties govern the validity interval of created assertions

#the number of minutes before "now" to start assertion lifetimes. Useful when communicated with unsynchronised systems.
validity.preskew = 5

#the lifetime of the assertion, in minutes. (If you are sure a site is within +/- 5 minute of your clock and you want at least 5
# minutes of validity you need a 5 minute preskew and a 15 minute life. This guarantees at least 5 minutes of lifetime, but might be 25 minutes if the skew is
# the other way. In a real application both machines need to refer to a common time source--see various net time protocols
validity.lifetime = 15
